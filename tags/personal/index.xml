      <description>&lt;p&gt;To start, let&amp;rsquo;s talk about some things else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from preparing for an internship early in the year and the initial days back at school, most of my time was spent on internships and work-related matters. Overall, things went relatively smoothly. In terms of work, I received an offer from one of the BAT companies during the latter part of the fall recruitment, and I had enjoyable conversations with their interviewers. As for school, since I decided not to pursue graduate studies in my senior year, my main focus was on my graduation project. Although the process was a bit challenging, I managed to find a topic that interests me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for other matters, let&amp;rsquo;s leave them aside for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year was primarily focused on work-related matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, my mentor asked me and another intern about our full-time conversion in the group chat. I hesitated for a long time, unsure how to respond, so I reached out to discuss it later. They wanted me to extend my internship a bit longer to finalize the project before starting the conversion process, hoping to help me secure a better offer. However, I was quite certain about leaving in December since I wanted to take a break. After a long internship, I wanted some time to truly relax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early Year&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the year, I received an internship offer from ByteDance, so I started right after school resumed in April. That&amp;rsquo;s when I met my first colleagues, my first mentor, and some intern friends. My first internship was in a business department, which had many senior colleagues who were very helpful to me. When they found out I was still a junior, they were quite surprised at my age, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t quite know how to handle that, so I focused on reading documents or doing other tasks. Transitioning from school to a company wasn&amp;rsquo;t as easy as I had imagined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, there were a few HR interns who helped me integrate into the company, probably spending a lot of effort on it. Initially, I just ran into Coco at the door. She was so enthusiastic and outgoing that she quickly introduced me to Trinity and Cindy. Both of them were also warm and outgoing, though a bit less &amp;ldquo;HR-like&amp;rdquo; compared to Coco, which wasn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily a bad thing. Cindy was the one who initially recruited me, but to be honest, I could barely remember who called me at that point, only some moments from the HR interview since it was my first experience and felt a bit overwhelming. It might also be that they didn&amp;rsquo;t take intern recruitment too seriously; during the fall recruitment HR interview, it felt more like a casual conversation rather than an assessment. Anyway, I can&amp;rsquo;t recall exactly when Cindy called, but I remember her name. I hadn&amp;rsquo;t met Trinity before, but I knew she was a warm-hearted person from Henan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three of them were capable assistants under Andy, and since I was the only intern in the team, they often came to talk to me and took good care of me. However, due to social anxiety and work reasons, I declined their invitations to hang out a few times, which I now regret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The HR role probably has intense competition and different career goals, so in the end, only Coco remained at the company. Trinity went back to prepare for graduate studies, and the other one pursued her master&amp;rsquo;s degree in Shanghai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was probably my first experience of farewells in the workplace. It was a bit sad, but the work at hand still had to be done. I could only wish them well in my heart, and tell myself that this is just part of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for my decision to transfer to another team, the awkward moments contacting HR are another story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Days in the Business Department&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to my mentor. In the team, people liked to call him &amp;ldquo;Yue Shen,&amp;rdquo; but I preferred to call him &amp;ldquo;Mentor,&amp;rdquo; a name I borrowed from a senior&amp;rsquo;s social media post that seemed particularly fitting. My mentor was actually our group&amp;rsquo;s tech lead, and he was usually busy with meetings, so he had Mo Boss guide me. Therefore, I essentially had two mentors. Since it was a business department, the typical work involved receiving and fulfilling requirements. Mo Boss was the one who guided me through the specific requirements, often cleaning up after my messy code, while Yue Shen answered my technical questions. He was usually busy but made time each week to answer my questions. Whether it was working on business tasks or answering questions, I learned a lot from both of them. The internship in the business department made me realize that business work is not just simple CRUD operations; understanding the business itself is crucial, and I learned a lot about this from my mentor and colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember one Q&amp;amp;A session particularly well. Because I didn&amp;rsquo;t fully understand the business, I had questions about the significance of these business-technical solutions. I wanted to know what business development and these technical solutions were all about. He told me that, at their core, these designs were about abstracting business needs, including user experience and process correctness. Business development is essentially about designing business abstractions. To me, this was a concise, precise, and correct answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was preparing for conversion, my mentor gave me a lot of advice. However, in the end, I decided to transfer to the infrastructure department, which meant I had to start the internship process again—a bit of a failed attempt. But I still wanted to try, hoping to develop more towards the technical side. After all, I&amp;rsquo;ve been seriously studying computer science for three to four years in college and wanted to make better use of what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned. So I mentioned the transfer to my mentor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why &amp;ldquo;again&amp;rdquo;? Because I had mentioned it before when I received an offer from Baidu&amp;rsquo;s search architecture team. At that time, I wanted to take some time to prepare for interviews and apply for other infrastructure roles during the fall recruitment. My mentor advised me not to go to Baidu, as he had left Baidu to join ByteDance and shared some reasons for his departure. In the end, I decided to stay. Looking back at my fall recruitment experience, this was probably the right decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to my transfer plan. The new team was the distributed storage team under the infrastructure department. I found the job posting on the BeiyouRen forum, contacted the given WeChat, and it turned out to be the department leader. We had a brief chat, and after much hesitation, I decided to give it a shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My current mentor, nicknamed &amp;ldquo;Dr.&amp;rdquo; because he has a PhD, interviewed me first. The first round went smoothly; Dr. was an interesting and friendly person, and the interview wasn&amp;rsquo;t too tough on me. The second round was with the leader, mostly discussing my projects for quite a while, so there wasn&amp;rsquo;t time for an algorithm question, which I completed afterward. In the end, I passed the interview. I was hesitant to try initially, but they reassured me that I could go through the interview process first to avoid any awkwardness if it didn&amp;rsquo;t work out, so I went ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After passing the interview, I decided to end my internship in the business department at the end of August. When I told Yue Shen, he understood my decision and was willing to let me try. He also shared his thoughts, suggesting that new graduates might want to work in a business department first since infrastructure work might not be as exciting as imagined. However, he also agreed that only through experience can you find what&amp;rsquo;s right, so he didn&amp;rsquo;t say much else. He did say that if I found the new role unsuitable, I could contact him to come back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having such a mentor and leader must be my luck. I also remembered when I first joined, HR friends told me Yue Shen had a good impression of me, and I chose to join my leader&amp;rsquo;s team among the interviewers, which led me to meet those friends—it all felt like fate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gradually, I began to believe in destiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I decided to leave, I rushed to push these processes through. I may have been too eager, and HR thought it wasn&amp;rsquo;t a good look. I agreed. But by that point, staying in that position felt like a burden, and I wanted to leave as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt sorry for my mentor, missed my colleagues in the team, and even felt nostalgic for my HR friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, it was announced within the team that I was leaving to prepare for graduate studies. At that time, only HR, my mentor, and Mo Boss knew I was transferring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goodbyes are inevitable, so I chose to leave quietly. On the last day, my mentor and Mo Boss had to leave early, and I happened to be away from my desk, missing my mentor&amp;rsquo;s Feishu message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A hurried goodbye is never perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the Transfer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, I joined CAIC and began my next internship. The biggest difference here was the cafeteria situation—long queues were common. The new team was great, and there were other interns I could talk to, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel too out of place initially. The people here seemed different from those in the business department—more technical and less involved with other teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, it was a good experience, though the end-of-day hours weren&amp;rsquo;t much earlier than in the business department, perhaps due to the project still being in the development phase, making it a bit tiring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from work, I made many new friends in the team. During work breaks, we shared a lot of laughs. In recent weeks, a few senior colleagues often invited me out for dinner or karaoke; Ray was willing to discuss technical matters with us and often recommended tech articles. A former Top 2 intern also occasionally joined, and seeing everyone so happy, I started to appreciate this internship experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It must be my luck that both teams I&amp;rsquo;ve interned with have great leaders, mentors, and colleagues. So far, I haven&amp;rsquo;t faced any harsh treatment or difficulties. Although we may not get to work together in my first full-time job, I am truly grateful to all of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The future is long, and I hope to meet again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still Confused&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s how work went this year—I completed most of my goals from last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I still feel confused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, I saw someone ask on the forum, &amp;ldquo;What kind of person do you want to be?&amp;rdquo; It reminded me of the question I&amp;rsquo;ve been pondering all year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What do I really want, and why?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My parents have been hoping I pursue graduate studies for the past year. I&amp;rsquo;m not against it, but I just don&amp;rsquo;t want to take the risk of preparing for exams. But they haven&amp;rsquo;t thought about how to approach grad school or what happens if I fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea that effort guarantees success is just self-reassuring lies. I&amp;rsquo;m no longer a child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need to think, judge, and bear the consequences myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality, the decision between work and graduate studies was made when I secured my internship. I never felt confused about it, although convincing my parents took effort. However, this effort was in vain since our premises were different. They simply came to accept my choice. I&amp;rsquo;ve never been particularly obedient since graduating middle school; it&amp;rsquo;s been this way for a long time. I just feel sorry for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What truly confuses me is making difficult choices—unspoken things that often involve people. For example, deciding to switch teams or leave, and many other things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do I want? I still don&amp;rsquo;t know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I won&amp;rsquo;t dwell on it. It&amp;rsquo;s an abstract question, after all. I only think about it quietly at night before drifting into sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe there will eventually be an answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last Year&amp;rsquo;s Plan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I&amp;rsquo;ve said all that, let&amp;rsquo;s move on to the new year plan. Last year&amp;rsquo;s plan involving online courses didn&amp;rsquo;t get completed due to work and slacking off after work, so I&amp;rsquo;m extending it into this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wishes I made last year did come true, though the process wasn&amp;rsquo;t always pleasant. But at least there were no major ups or downs, and I feel I grew in some way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Year Plan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Study operating systems, databases, and distributed systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complete my graduation project and prepare for work-related matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work well and live well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exercise more, use my phone less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Year Wishes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope those around me stay healthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope to meet new friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope I can keep thinking independently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope I can handle work, studies, and life smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope everything works out well for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
