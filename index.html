<p>
        Borg is a cluster management system, similar to the closed-source version of Kubernetes (k8s).
It achieves high utilization through admission control, efficient task packing, overcommitment, machine sharing, and process-level performance isolation. It provides runtime features to reduce failure recovery time for high-availability applications and scheduling policies that reduce the probability of correlated failures. It offers a declarative job description language, DNS integration, real-time job monitoring, and tools for analyzing and simulating system behavior, simplifying usage for end-users.

<p>
        An old paper by AWS, Dynamo has been in the market for a long time, and the architecture has likely evolved since the paper&rsquo;s publication. Despite this, the paper was selected as one of the SIGMOD best papers of the year, and there are still many valuable lessons to learn.
Design Dynamo is a NoSQL product that provides a key-value storage interface. It emphasizes high availability rather than consistency, which leads to differences in architectural design and technical choices compared to other systems.

        This article introduces the design considerations of AWS&rsquo;s database product, Aurora, including storage-compute separation, single-writer multi-reader architecture, and quorum-based NRW consistency protocol. The article also mentions how PolarDB was inspired by Aurora, with differences in addressing network bottlenecks and system call overhead. Aurora is a database product provided by AWS, primarily aimed at OLTP business scenarios. In terms of design, there are several aspects worth noting: The design premise of

        This post provides a brief overview of the Chain Replication (CR) paper, which introduces a simple but effective algorithm for providing linearizable consistency in storage services. For those interested in the detailed design, it&rsquo;s best to refer directly to the original paper.
Introduction In short, the Chain Replication (CR) paper presents a replicated state machine algorithm designed for storage services that require linearizable consistency. It uses a chain replication method to improve throughput and relies on multiple replicas to ensure service availability.

Positioning ZooKeeper is a wait-free, high-performance coordination service for distributed applications. It supports the coordination needs of distributed applications by providing coordination primitives (specific APIs and data models).
Design Keywords There are two key phrases in ZooKeeper&rsquo;s positioning: high performance and distributed application coordination service.

Main Process The main write logic of LevelDB is relatively simple. First, the write operation is encapsulated into a WriteBatch, and then it is executed.

        Earlier, I looked at the code of Casbin-Mesh because I wanted to try GSOC. Casbin-Mesh is a distributed Casbin application based on Raft. This RaftKV in MIT6.824 is quite similar, so I took the opportunity to write this blog.
Lab Overview Lab 03 involves building a distributed KV service based on Raft. We need to implement the server and client for this service.
The structure of RaftKV and the interaction between its modules are shown below:

        Finally, I managed to complete Lab 02 during this winter break, which had been on hold for quite some time. I was stuck on one of the cases in Test 2B for a while. During the winter break, I revisited the implementations from experts, and finally completed all the tasks, so I decided to document them briefly.
Algorithm Overview The basis of consensus algorithms is the replicated state machine, which means that executing the same deterministic commands in the same order will eventually lead to a consistent state.

    </small>
  
<p>
        Some time ago, I decided to implement a simple LSM storage engine model. As part of that, I implemented a basic SkipList and BloomFilter with BitSet. However, due to work demands and after-hours laziness, the project was put on hold. Now that I&rsquo;m thinking about it again, I realize I&rsquo;ve forgotten some of the details, so I&rsquo;m writing it down for future reference.
What is SkipList? SkipList is an ordered data structure that can be seen as an alternative to balanced trees.

        The primary project in my group is a distributed file system (DFS) that provides POSIX file system semantics. The approach to handle &ldquo;lots of small files&rdquo; (LOSF) is inspired by Haystack, which is specifically designed for small files. I decided to read through the Haystack paper and take some notes as a learning exercise.
These notes are not an in-depth analysis of specific details but rather a record of my thoughts on the problem and design approach.

        I recently found a translated version of the Bigtable paper online and saved it, but hadn&rsquo;t gotten around to reading it. Lately, I&rsquo;ve noticed that Bigtable shares many design similarities with a current project in our group, so I took some time over the weekend to read through it.
This is the last of Google&rsquo;s three foundational distributed system papers, and although it wasn&rsquo;t originally part of the MIT6.824 reading list, I&rsquo;ve categorized it here for consistency.

        This article introduces the Google File System (GFS) paper published in 2003, which proposed a distributed file system designed to store large volumes of data reliably, meeting Google&rsquo;s data storage needs. This write-up reflects on the design goals, trade-offs, and architectural choices of GFS.
Introduction GFS is a distributed file system developed by Google to meet the needs of data-intensive applications, using commodity hardware to provide a scalable and fault-tolerant solution.

        Let&rsquo;s start with epoll.
epoll is an I/O event notification mechanism in the Linux kernel, designed to replace select and poll. It aims to efficiently handle large numbers of file descriptors and supports the system&rsquo;s maximum file open limit, providing excellent performance.
Usage API epoll has three primary system calls:
/** epoll_create * Creates an epoll instance and returns a file descriptor for it. * Needs to be closed afterward, as epfd also consumes the system&#39;s fd resources.

<p>
        The motivation for this post comes from an interview question I was asked: What is CPU false sharing?
CPU Cache Let&rsquo;s start by discussing CPU cache.
CPU cache is a type of storage medium introduced to bridge the speed gap between the CPU and main memory. In the pyramid-shaped storage hierarchy, it is located just below CPU registers. Its capacity is much smaller than that of main memory, but its speed can be close to the processor&rsquo;s frequency.

Problems with HTTP Communication uses plain text, making it susceptible to eavesdropping. Unable to verify the identity of the communication party, making it vulnerable to spoofing (e.g., Denial of Service attacks). Cannot guarantee message integrity, making it possible for messages to be altered (e.

        The third year of university has been quite intense, leaving me with little time to continue my studies on 6.824, so my progress stalled at Lab 1. With a bit more free time during the winter break, I decided to continue. Each paper or experiment will be recorded in this article.
This is the first chapter of my Distributed System study notes.
About the Paper The core content of the paper is the proposed MapReduce distributed computing model and the approach to implementing the Distributed MapReduce System, including the Master data structure, fault tolerance, and some refinements.
